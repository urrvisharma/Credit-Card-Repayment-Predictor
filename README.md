My teammates and I analyzed a dataset from Kaggle that included information like income, date of birth, ownership of cars/property, and whether each individual had a credit card or not. 
We used two machine learning methods, decision trees and Knn to predict what features correlate highly with whether or not someone will repay their debt or not.
